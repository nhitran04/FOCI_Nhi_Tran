% Potential Challenges

Crowdsourcing server-side training for new Geneva strategies poses significant challenges, one of which includes handling increased demand if this webpage becomes more popular. We expect to be cautious about how we provision our server instances as we build this webpage. The possibility for growth comes with the risk of dealing with dishonest and untrustworthy clients. Since our webpage relies nearly entirely on the client to locally perform server-side training, we must determine if the client will provide accurate information on which Geneva strategies worked best or if they issued the requests correctly as instructed by the server. There may also be clients with malicious intentions to attack the server and cause it to fail or breach user privacy by seeking out their confidential information (e.g., optimal strategies that the user discovered, who the user is, etc.). Such issues would need to be addressed in order to ensure the accuracy of our data, prevent server crashes, and protect usersâ€™ data.
